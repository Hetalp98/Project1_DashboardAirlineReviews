# Project1_DashboardAirlineReviews

I created this interactive Tableau dashboard to explore how customers rated their experiences with British Airways from 2016 to 2023. The dashboard breaks down key service areas like cabin staff, entertainment, food, ground service, seat comfort, and value for money, and lets users dig into the data by month, country, aircraft type, and traveller profile.

To build it, I started by preparing the dataset in Excel, then brought it into Tableau where I designed custom visuals including KPI cards, time trend lines, maps, and comparison charts. I added filters and parameters so users can interact with the dashboard and explore different views.

This project helped me practice turning raw data into meaningful insights while building a clean, engaging dashboard that tells a story. It was also a fun way to sharpen my Tableau skills and try out advanced features like parameter-based filtering and dual-axis visuals.
